## Description

This project focuses on implementing various recursive functions in the C programming language. The functions perform tasks such as printing a string in reverse, calculating the factorial of a number, raising a number to a power, finding the square root, determining if a number is prime, and checking for palindromes.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following structure:

- **Repository:** alx-low_level_programming
- **Directory:** 0x08-recursion
- **Files:**
    - `0-puts_recursion.c`
    - `1-print_rev_recursion.c`
    - `2-strlen_recursion.c`
    - `3-factorial.c`
    - `4-pow_recursion.c`
    - `5-sqrt_recursion.c`
    - `6-is_prime_number.c`
    - `100-is_palindrome.c`
    - `101-wildcmp.c`
    - ...

## Coding Style

The code follows the Betty style, as outlined in the provided instructions. The usage of global variables is not allowed, and each file contains no more than 5 functions. The header file `main.h` includes the prototypes of all functions and the `_putchar` function.

## Tasks

### Task 0: She locked away a secret, deep inside herself, something she once knew to be true... but chose to forget<a name="task-0"></a>
- Prototype: `void _puts_recursion(char *s);`

### Task 1: Why is it so important to dream? Because, in my dreams we are together<a name="task-1"></a>
- Prototype: `void _print_rev_recursion(char *s);`

### Task 2: Dreams feel real while we're in them. It's only when we wake up that we realize something was actually strange<a name="task-2"></a>
- Prototype: `int _strlen_recursion(char *s);`

### Task 3: You mustn't be afraid to dream a little bigger, darling<a name="task-3"></a>
- Prototype: `int factorial(int n);`

### Task 4: Once an idea has taken hold of the brain it's almost impossible to eradicate<a name="task-4"></a>
- Prototype: `int _pow_recursion(int x, int y);`

### Task 5: Your subconscious is looking for the dreamer<a name="task-5"></a>
- Prototype: `int _sqrt_recursion(int n);`

### Task 6: Inception. Is it possible?<a name="task-6"></a>
- Prototype: `int is_prime_number(int n);`

### Task 7: They say we only use a fraction of our brain's true potential. Now that's when we're awake. When we're asleep, we can do almost anything<a name="task-7"></a>
- Prototype: `int is_palindrome(char *s);`

### Task 8: Inception. Now, before you bother telling me it's impossible...<a name="task-8"></a>
- Prototype: `int wildcmp(char *s1, char *s2);`

**Note:** Each task is implemented in its respective file within the `0x08-recursion` directory.

**Important:** The README.md file adheres to the standard format and provides an overview of the project, its structure, coding style, and details about each task. Make sure to update it with additional information if necessary.
