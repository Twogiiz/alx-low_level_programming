# C - Debugging

## Tasks

### 0. Multiple mains (mandatory)
In most projects, we often provide you with only one main file to test with. For this task, you need to create a new main file, `0-main.c`, to test the function `positive_or_negative()`. The function is responsible for printing whether an integer is positive, negative, or zero.

### 1. Like, comment, subscribe (mandatory)
Copy the provided main file, `1-main.c`, and identify the part of the code that is causing an infinite loop. Comment out (don't delete!) that section of the code to avoid the infinite loop.

### 2. 0 > 972? (mandatory)
This program aims to print the largest of three integers. However, there is an issue with the current implementation. You need to fix the `largest_number()` function in `2-largest_number.c` so that it correctly prints out the largest of the three numbers, considering all possible cases.

### 3. Leap year (mandatory)
This program converts a given date to the day of the year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap years into account. The current implementation in `3-print_remaining_days.c` contains an issue when dealing with leap years. You need to fix the `print_remaining_days()` function to handle leap years correctly and provide accurate outputs for all dates and leap years.

Remember to compile your programs using the provided compilation flags when necessary, and ensure that your code adheres to the requirements specified in the task descriptions.

**Note:** Line count will not be checked for tasks 1, 2, and 3.
