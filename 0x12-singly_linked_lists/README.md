C - Singly Linked Lists
This project explores singly linked lists in C and implementing functions to manipulate linked list data structures.

Description
In this project, a custom singly linked list (list_t) data structure is defined with nodes containing a string value and pointer to the next node. Functions are implemented for:

Printing linked list elements
Returning number of elements
Adding nodes at the beginning and end
Freeing an entire linked list
The goal is to learn basics of linked lists by implementing core functionality like traversal, length calcuation, insertion, and memory management.

Files

2-add_node.c	Function adds node at beginning of list
3-add_node_end.c	Function adds node at end of list
4-free_list.c	Function frees an entire linked list
