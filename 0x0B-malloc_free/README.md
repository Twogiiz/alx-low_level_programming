3. If you even dream of beating me you'd better wake up and apologize
3-alloc_grid.c: Function that returns a pointer to a 2D array of integers initialized to 0. Returns NULL on failure.
4. It's not bragging if you can back it up
4-free_grid.c: Function to free a 2D grid previously allocated with alloc_grid.
5. It isn't the mountains ahead to climb that wear you out; it's the pebble in your shoe
100-argstostr.c: Function that concatenates all arguments of the program into a new string.
